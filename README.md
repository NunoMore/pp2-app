# Welcome to your PP2 app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npm start
   ```

3. View app

   - just press "w" for web browser
   - alternatively for ios or android testing, [`download Expo Go app`](https://expo.dev/go) and scan the QR code provided before by "npm start"

4. Pull changes

   ```bash
    git pull
   ```

5. Add changes

   ```bash
    git commit -m "some message"
    git add .
    git push
   ```

   - this done for the branch "dev_css" will automatically trigger the action to deploy (number 5)
   - you can verify the action in the ACTIONS tab in github. It should take 2 or 3 minutes to deploy your changes
